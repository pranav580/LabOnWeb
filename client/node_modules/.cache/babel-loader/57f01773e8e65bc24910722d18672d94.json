Diode Equation In the forward-biased and reversed-biased regions, the current (If), and the voltage (Vf), of a semiconductor diode are related by the diode equation: If=Is\\xD7(expVfn\\xD7VT\\u22121) where, Is is reverse saturation current or leakage current, If is current through the diode(forward current), Vf is potential difference across the diode terminals(forward voltage) VT is thermal voltage, given by VT=k\\xD7Tq and k is Boltzmann\\u2019s constant = 1.38x10\\u221223 J /\\xB0Kelvin, q is the electronic charge = 1.6x10\\u221219 joules/volt(Coulombs), T is the absolute temperature in \\xB0Kelvin(\\xB0K = 273 + temperature in \\xB0C), At room temperature (25 \\xB0C), the thermal voltage is about 25.7 mV, n is an empirical constant between 0.5 and 2 The empirical constant, n, is a number that can vary according to the voltage and current levels. It depends on electron drift, diffusion, and carrier recombination in the depletion region. Among the quantities affecting the value of n are the diode manufacture, levels of doping and purity of materials. If n=1, the value of k\\xD7Tq is 26 mV at 25\\xB0C. When n=2, the value of k\\xD7Tq becomes 52 mV. For germanium diodes, n is usually considered to be close to 1. For silicon diodes, n is in the range of 1.3 to 1.6. Note Ideal Diode Model:Diode is a simple switch that is either closed (conducting) or open (non conducting). Specifically, the diode is a short circuit, like a closed switch, when voltage is applied in the forward direction, and an open circuit, like an open switch, when the voltage is applied in the reverse direction. Offset Voltage Model:The offset voltage model adds the barrier potential to the ideal switch model. When the diode is forward biased it is equivalent to a closed switch in series with a small equivalent voltage source equal to the barrier potential (0.6 V for Silicon, 0.2 for germanium) with the positive side towards the anode. When the diode is reverse biased, it is equivalent to an open switch just as in the ideal model. Complete diode Model:It is the most accurate of the diode models. The Complete diode model of a diode consists of the barrier potential, the small forward dynamic resistance and the ideal diode. The resistor approximates the semiconductor resistance under forward bias. This diode model most accurately represents the true operating characteristics of the real diode. When a diode is reverse biased a leakage current flows through the device. This current can be effectively ignored as long as the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode is not exceeded. At potentials greater than the reverse breakdown voltage, charge is pulled through the p-n junction by the strong electric fields in the device and large reverse current flows. This usually destroys the device. There are special diodes that are designed to operate in breakdown. Such diodes are called zener diodes and used as voltage regulators. When is each Model used ? Ideal Diode Model: This is primarily used in troubleshooting. Is the diode working or not. The greatest utility of the ideal diode model is in determining which diodes are on and which are off in a multi-diode circuit. Offset Voltage Model:This is used when a more accurate determination of load current or voltage is required. Complete Diode Model:This is use during the actual design of circuits using diodes.\"]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 12,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n};\n\n_c = ExpPage;\nexport default ExpPage; // http://ec2-18-191-175-183.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:\n//                     hello\n//                     <form name='form1' method=\"get\" action=\"http://localhost:5000/req_data\">\n//                         <table>\n//                             <tr>\n//                                 <td>Voltage</td>\n//                                 <td><input type=\"text\" name=\"Voltage\"/></td>\n//                             </tr>\n//                             <tr>\n//                                 <td align=\"center\">\n//                                     <input type=\"submit\" name='btnsubmit' value=\"Show Value\"/>\n//                                 </td>\n//                             </tr>\n//                         </table>\n//                     </form>\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"ExpPage\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["D:/Code/LabOnWeb/client/src/Components/ExpPage.jsx"],"names":["ExpPage"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,kBAAP;;;AAEA,MAAMA,OAAO,GAAG,MAAK;AACjB,sBACI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;AAAA,4BACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADJ,eAEI;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA,8BACI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADJ,eAEI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFJ,eAGI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAHJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAFJ,eAOI;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;AAAA,8BACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFJ,eAII;AAAA,iGAEA;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA,iCACA;AAAA,oCACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAHJ,eAII;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAJJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAJJ,eAgBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAhBJ,eAkBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAlBJ,sCA2BI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cA3BJ,eA6BI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cA7BJ,4BAmCI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAnCJ,eAqCI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cArCJ,4BA4CI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cA5CJ,eAiDI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAjDJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAPJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADJ;AAsIC,CAvIL;;KAAMA,O;AAyIU,eAAeA,OAAf,C,CAmBhB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA","sourcesContent":["import \"./components.css\";\r\n\r\nconst ExpPage = () =>{\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"ExpPage\">\r\n            <h1>VI Characteristics of a Diode</h1>\r\n            <div className=\"tools\">\r\n                <div className=\"theory\">Theory</div>\r\n                <div className=\"procedure\">Procedure</div>\r\n                <div className=\"perform\">Perform</div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"theoryshow\">\r\n                <h1>Theory</h1>\r\n                <h2>Objectives</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                At the end of the experiment, the student should be able to :\r\n                <div className=\"objol\">\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>Explain the structure of a P-N junction diode</li>\r\n                    <li>Explain the function of a P-N junction diode</li>\r\n                    <li>Explain forward and reverse biased characteristics of a Silicon diode</li>\r\n                    <li>Explain forward and reverse biased characteristics of a Germanium diode</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                </div>\r\n                </p>\r\n                \r\n                <h2>Structure of P-N junction diode</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>The diode is a device formed from a junction of n-type and p-type semiconductor material.

The diode will act like an open switch and there is no current flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Diode Equation\r\n\r\n                In the forward-biased and reversed-biased regions, the current (If), and the voltage (Vf), of a semiconductor diode are related by the diode equation:\r\n\r\n                If=Is×(expVfn×VT−1)\r\n\r\n\r\n                where,\r\n                Is is reverse saturation current or leakage current,\r\n                If is current through the diode(forward current),\r\n                Vf is potential difference across the diode terminals(forward voltage)\r\n                VT is thermal voltage, given by\r\n                VT=k×Tq\r\n\r\n\r\n                and\r\n                k is Boltzmann’s constant = 1.38x10−23 J /°Kelvin,\r\n                q is the electronic charge = 1.6x10−19 joules/volt(Coulombs),\r\n                T is the absolute temperature in °Kelvin(°K = 273 + temperature in °C),\r\n                At room temperature (25 °C), the thermal voltage is about 25.7 mV,\r\n                n is an empirical constant between 0.5 and 2\r\n\r\n                The empirical constant, n, is a number that can vary according to the voltage and current levels. It depends on electron drift, diffusion, and carrier recombination in the depletion region. Among the quantities affecting the value of n are the diode manufacture, levels of doping and purity of materials.\r\n\r\n                If n=1, the value of k×Tq is 26 mV at 25°C.\r\n                When n=2, the value of k×Tq becomes 52 mV. For germanium diodes, n is usually considered to be close to 1. For silicon diodes, n is in the range of 1.3 to 1.6.\r\n\r\n                Note\r\n\r\n                Ideal Diode Model:Diode is a simple switch that is either closed (conducting) or open (non conducting). Specifically, the diode is a short circuit, like a closed switch, when voltage is applied in the forward direction, and an open circuit, like an open switch, when the voltage is applied in the reverse direction.\r\n                Offset Voltage Model:The offset voltage model adds the barrier potential to the ideal switch model. When the diode is forward biased it is equivalent to a closed switch in series with a small equivalent voltage source equal to the barrier potential (0.6 V for Silicon, 0.2 for germanium) with the positive side towards the anode. When the diode is reverse biased, it is equivalent to an open switch just as in the ideal model.\r\n                Complete diode Model:It is the most accurate of the diode models. The Complete diode model of a diode consists of the barrier potential, the small forward dynamic resistance and the ideal diode. The resistor approximates the semiconductor resistance under forward bias. This diode model most accurately represents the true operating characteristics of the real diode.\r\n                When a diode is reverse biased a leakage current flows through the device. This current can be effectively ignored as long as the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode is not exceeded. At potentials greater than the reverse breakdown voltage, charge is pulled through the p-n junction by the strong electric fields in the device and large reverse current flows. This usually destroys the device. There are special diodes that are designed to operate in breakdown. Such diodes are called zener diodes and used as voltage regulators.\r\n\r\n\r\n                When is each Model used ?\r\n\r\n                Ideal Diode Model: This is primarily used in troubleshooting. Is the diode working or not. The greatest utility of the ideal diode model is in determining which diodes are on and which are off in a multi-diode circuit.\r\n\r\n                Offset Voltage Model:This is used when a more accurate determination of load current or voltage is required.\r\n\r\n                Complete Diode Model:This is use during the actual design of circuits using diodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\n                export default ExpPage;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// http://ec2-18-191-175-183.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:\r\n//                     hello\r\n//                     <form name='form1' method=\"get\" action=\"http://localhost:5000/req_data\">\r\n//                         <table>\r\n//                             <tr>\r\n//                                 <td>Voltage</td>\r\n//                                 <td><input type=\"text\" name=\"Voltage\"/></td>\r\n//                             </tr>\r\n//                             <tr>\r\n//                                 <td align=\"center\">\r\n//                                     <input type=\"submit\" name='btnsubmit' value=\"Show Value\"/>\r\n//                                 </td>\r\n//                             </tr>\r\n//                         </table>\r\n//                     </form>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
