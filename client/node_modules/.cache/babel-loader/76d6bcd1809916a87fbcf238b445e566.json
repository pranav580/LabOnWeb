The electrons that cross the p–n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Figurer:3\r\n\r\n            <h2>Function of a P-N junction diode in Reverse Bias</h2>\r\n\r\n            <p>The positive terminal of battery is connected to the N side(cathode) and the negative terminal of battery is connected to the P side(anode) of a diode.

Likewise, because the n-type region is connected to the positive terminal, the electrons will also be pulled away from the junction, with similar effect. This increases the voltage barrier causing a high resistance to the flow of charge carriers, thus allowing minimal electric current to cross the p–n junction. The increase in resistance of the p–n junction results in the junction behaving as an insulator.\r\n            The strength of the depletion zone electric field increases as the reverse-bias voltage increases. Once the electric field intensity increases beyond a critical level, the p–n junction depletion zone breaks down and current begins to flow, usually by either the Zener or the avalanche breakdown processes. Both of these breakdown processes are non-destructive and are reversible, as long as the amount of current flowing does not reach levels that cause the semiconductor material to overheat and cause thermal damage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <h2>Forward and reverse biased characteristics of a Silicon diode</h2>\r\n\r\n            <p><b>In forward biasing</b>, the positive terminal of battery is connected to the P side and the negative terminal of battery is connected to the N side of the diode.
